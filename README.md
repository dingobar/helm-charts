Forked from larribas/helm-charts, the all credit for creating the chart goes to him.

The reason for forking this is:

- Being able to patch and release it myself
- Fix some issues there were in the chart to be able to use it

# Helm Charts

This is my personal Helm Chart repository. You can point helm to it via

```bash
helm repo add dingobar https://dingobar.github.io/helm-charts/
```

You should bring your own mlflow image, since the one we use is private. I may publish a public one later.

## Charts

- [MLFlow](mlflow/README.md) (stable and production-ready) - An open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle ([mlflow.org](https://mlflow.org/))
